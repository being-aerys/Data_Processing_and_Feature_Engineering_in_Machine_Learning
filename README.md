# Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning
This is a project to showcase different dimensionality reduction techniques helpful in machine learning.
Each jupyter notebook itself is a standalone illustration of the technique covered in that notebook.

## Dependencies
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. sklearn


## Installation
1. Clone the repo or download using the url: https://github.com/intelaashish/Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Machine_Learning.git
2. Open a jupyter notebook session locally and navigate to the directory with the jupyter notebooks in this repo.
3. Open the jupyter notebook for the dimensionality reduction technque that you are interested in.

## Dimensionality Reduction Methods Covered
1. Zero-Variance Feature Removal

# Work in Progress
1. Multicollinearity

## Dimensionality Reduction Methods to be Covered
1. PCA
2. LDA, etc.
