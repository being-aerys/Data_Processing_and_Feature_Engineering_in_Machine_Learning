# Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning
This is a project to showcase different dimensionality reduction techniques helpful in machine learning.
Each jupyter notebook itself is a standalone illustration of the technique covered in that notebook.

## Dependencies
This project requires python and the following python libraries.
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn

It also requires a software that can open and execute a Jupyter Notebook.


## Installation
1. Clone the repo or download using the url: https://github.com/intelaashish/Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Machine_Learning.git
2. Download the necessary data from the Data section below for the required technoque.
3. Navigate to the top-level project directory that contains this readme file.
4. Go to Source_Codes directory.
5. Run the following command:
    ```properties
        jupyter notebook
     

6. This will open a tab on a web browser.
7. Click on the file for the dimensionality reduction technque that you are interested in.
